# Performance Optimization Rules
# Configuration for rubocop-performance plugin
# Focused on Ruby performance patterns for Rails 6.0+ applications

# Load the rubocop-performance plugin
plugins:
  - rubocop-performance

# Note: Performance cops are now provided by the rubocop-performance gem
# This configuration file provides sensible defaults for performance-oriented development

# Enable all performance cops by default (can be overridden individually)
Performance:
  Enabled: true

# Specific configurations for key performance cops
Performance/OpenStruct:
  Enabled: false # Can be too restrictive in some Rails applications
  Severity: warning

Performance/StringIdentifierArgument:
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning # Warn instead of error for gradual adoption

Performance/ChainArrayAllocation:
  Enabled: true
  # Allow chaining in test files where readability is more important
  Exclude:
    - "spec/**/*"
    - "test/**/*"

Performance/CollectionLiteralInLoop:
  Enabled: true
  # More permissive in configuration and initializer files
  Exclude:
    - "config/**/*"
    - "db/**/*"

# ==========================================

Performance/BlockGivenWithExplicitBlock:
  Description: |
    Use block_given? efficiently with explicit blocks. When a method accepts
    an explicit block parameter (&block), using block_given? is redundant
    because you can check if the block parameter is nil. This improves performance
    by avoiding unnecessary method calls.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/ConstantRegexp:
  Description: |
    Use constant regexps for better performance. Creating regexp objects
    repeatedly in loops or frequently-called methods is expensive. Store
    regexps in constants to avoid recompilation and improve performance
    in performance-critical code paths.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/MethodObjectAsBlock:
  Description: |
    Use method objects as blocks when appropriate for better performance.
    Using &:method_name syntax is often more performant than creating
    explicit blocks, especially in collection methods like map, select, etc.
    This reduces object allocation overhead.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/RedundantEqualityComparisonBlock:
  Description: |
    Avoid redundant equality comparison blocks in collection methods.
    Instead of arr.select { |x| x == value }, use more direct approaches
    or built-in methods when available. This reduces unnecessary block
    calls and improves performance.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/RedundantSplitRegexpArgument:
  Description: |
    Avoid redundant regexp arguments to String#split. When splitting on
    single characters, use string arguments instead of regexp for better
    performance. For example, use str.split(',') instead of str.split(/,/).
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/StringInclude:
  Description: |
    Use String#include? instead of String#match? when you only need to
    check for substring presence. #include? is faster for simple substring
    checks because it doesn't need to compile regexp patterns or capture groups.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/Sum:
  Description: |
    Use Array#sum instead of inject(:+) or reduce(:+) for numeric calculations.
    Array#sum is optimized for numeric operations and provides better performance
    and clearer intent when summing arrays of numbers.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning

Performance/RangeInclude:
  Description: |
    Use Range#cover? instead of Range#include? for performance. #cover? only
    checks if the value falls within the range boundaries, while #include?
    iterates through all values in the range, making #cover? much faster
    for large ranges.
  Enabled: true
  Severity: warning
