## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-hk', '~> 1.2.2', require: false
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a `.rubocop.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-hk: config/default.yml
```

2. Run RuboCop:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

3. Review warnings and gradually promote them to errors when your team is ready:

```bash
# View current warnings
bundle exec rubocop --format json | jq '.files[].offenses[] | select(.severity=="warning")'

# Use the promotion script (see documentation)
ruby scripts/promote-warnings.rb
```

RuboCop HK provides several preconfigured options:

- `config/default.yml` - Balanced configuration with modern warning-only rules
- `config/strict.yml` - More stringent rules for mature codebases
- `config/rails.yml` - Rails-specific optimizations
